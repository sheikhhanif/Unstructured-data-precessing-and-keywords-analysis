This transaction was identified as a potential source of concern in a whistleblower report made after the Private Company filed for bankruptcy.

Although the transaction did not involve us or our subsidiaries, it was investigated because it did involve certain senior executive officers of our general partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company at the time of the transaction.
Based upon its investigation, counsel for the subcommittee found that, subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, although certain irregularities occurred in the transactions, the transaction did not appear to cause the relevant officers to understand or believe that the Private Company had a lack of liquidity that imperiled the Private Company s ability to meet its obligations to us and that certain aspects of the documentation of the transaction that were out of the ordinary did not call into question the integrity of any of the relevant officers.

Based upon this investigation, and subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, counsel for the subcommittee found that each of the officers had access to and reviewed Private Company financial information, including information regarding the Private Company s commodity trading activities, from which they could have developed an understanding of the nature and significance of the trading activities that led to liquidity problems at the Private Company well before they say they did.

While the officers each stated sincerely that they did not understand the nature or extent of the Private Company s trading-related problems until the first week of July 2008 or later, objective evidence suggests that they showed at least some indifference to known or easily discoverable facts and that they failed to adhere to procedures under the Private Company s Risk Management Policy created expressly to ensure that the Private Company s trading activities were properly monitored.

This transaction was identified as a potential source of concern in a whistleblower report made after the Private Company filed for bankruptcy.
This transaction was identified as a potential source of concern in a whistleblower report made after the Private Company filed for bankruptcy.
Although the transaction did not involve the Partnership or its subsidiaries, it was investigated because it did involve certain senior executive officers of the Partnership s general partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company at the time of the transaction.
Although the transaction did not involve the Partnership or its subsidiaries, it was investigated because it did involve certain senior executive officers of the Partnership s general partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company at the time of the transaction.
Based upon its investigation, counsel for the subcommittee found that, subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, although certain irregularities occurred in the transactions, the transaction did not appear to cause the relevant officers to understand or believe that the Private Company had a lack of liquidity that imperiled the Private Company s ability to meet its obligations to the Partnership and that certain aspects of the documentation of the transaction that were out of the ordinary did not call into question the integrity of any of the relevant officers.

F-39 Table of Contents The subcommittee also investigated whether certain senior executive officers of the Partnership s general partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company knew and understood, beginning as early as July 2007 and at various times thereafter, about a lack of liquidity at the Private Company that imperiled the Private Company s ability to meet its obligations to the Partnership.

Based upon this investigation, and subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, counsel for the subcommittee found that each of the officers had access to and reviewed Private Company financial information, including information regarding the Private Company s commodity trading activities, from which they could have developed an understanding of the nature and significance of the trading activities that led to liquidity problems at the Private Company well before they say they did.

While the officers each stated sincerely that they did not understand the nature or extent of the Private Company s trading-related problems until the first week of July 2008 or later, objective evidence suggests that they showed at least some indifference to known or easily discoverable facts and that they failed to adhere to procedures under the Private Company s Risk Management Policy created expressly to ensure that the Private Company s trading activities were properly monitored.

Nonetheless, counsel for the subcommittee was not persuaded by the documents and other evidence it was able to access that the officers in fact knew and understood that the Private Company s liquidity or capital needs were a significant cause for alarm until, at the earliest, the second quarter of 2008.

Moreover, while it appeared to counsel that the officers developed a growing awareness of the nature and severity of the Private Company s liquidity issues over the second quarter of 2008, counsel was unable to identify with any more precision the specific level of concern or understanding these individuals had prior to July 2008.

This transaction was identified as a potential source of concern in a whistleblower report made after the Private Company filed for bankruptcy.
This transaction was identified as a potential source of concern in a whistleblower report made after the Private Company filed for bankruptcy.
Although the transaction did not involve the Partnership or its subsidiaries, it was investigated because it did involve certain senior executive officers of the General Partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company at the time of the transaction.
Although the transaction did not involve the Partnership or its subsidiaries, it was investigated because it did involve certain senior executive officers of the General Partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company at the time of the transaction.
Based upon its investigation, counsel for the subcommittee found that, subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, although certain irregularities occurred in the transactions, the transaction did not appear to cause the relevant officers to understand or believe that the Private Company had a lack of liquidity that imperiled the Private Company s ability to meet its obligations to the Partnership and that certain aspects of the documentation of the transaction that were out of the ordinary did not call into question the integrity of any of the relevant officers.

The subcommittee also investigated whether certain senior executive officers of the General Partner who were also senior executive officers of the Private Company knew and understood, beginning as early as July 2007 and at various times thereafter, about a lack of liquidity at the Private Company that imperiled the Private Company s ability to meet its obligations to the Partnership.

Based upon this investigation, and subject to the subcommittee s lack of access to Private Company documents and electronic records and witnesses, counsel for the subcommittee found that each of the officers had access to and reviewed Private Company financial information, including information regarding the Private Company s commodity trading activities, from which they could have developed an understanding of the nature and significance of the trading activities that led to liquidity problems at the Private Company well before they say they did.

While the officers each stated sincerely that they did not understand the nature or extent of the Private Company s trading-related problems until the first week of July 2008 or later, objective evidence suggests that they showed at least some indifference to known or easily discoverable facts and that they failed to adhere to procedures under the Private Company s Risk Management Policy created expressly to ensure that the Private Company s trading activities were properly monitored.

Nonetheless, counsel for the subcommittee was not persuaded by the documents and other evidence it was able to access that the officers in fact knew and understood that the Private Company s liquidity or capital needs were a significant cause for alarm until, at the earliest, the second quarter of 2008.

Moreover, while it appeared to counsel that the officers developed a growing awareness of the nature and severity of the Private Company s liquidity issues over the second quarter of 2008, counsel was unable to identify with any more precision the specific level of concern or understanding these individuals had prior to July 2008.
