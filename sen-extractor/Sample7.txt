The financial crisis reached unprecedented levels of market volatility and has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the Company s business and results of operations Markets in the United States and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months, due largely to the stresses affecting the global financial systems, which accelerated significantly in the second half of 2008.

The United States entered a severe recession in 2008, and although some improvement in the economic environment began in the latter part of the first quarter of 2009, a sluggish economy may persist well into 2010 and possibly beyond, despite past and future expected governmental intervention in the world s major economies.

Throughout 2008 and most of the first quarter of 2009, these circumstances exerted significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and virtually all other asset classes and resulted in substantially increased market volatility, severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence.

If the value of any mortgage loan is determined to be impaired (i.e., when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement), the carrying value of the mortgage loan is reduced to either the present value of expected cash flows from the loan, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or fair value of the collateral.
If the value of any mortgage loan is determined to be impaired (i.e., when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement), the carrying value of the mortgage loan is reduced to either the present value of expected cash flows from the loan, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or fair value of the collateral.
For those mortgages that are determined to require foreclosure, the carrying value is reduced to the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated costs to obtain and sell at the point of foreclosure.
For those mortgages that are determined to require foreclosure, the carrying value is reduced to the fair value of the underlying collateral, net of estimated costs to obtain and sell at the point of foreclosure.
The carrying value of the impaired loans is reduced by establishing a permanent write-down recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses).
The carrying value of the impaired loans is reduced by establishing a permanent write-down recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses).
Policy loans : The reported value of policy loans is equal to the carrying, or cash surrender, value of the loans.

Policy loans are fully collateralized by the account value of the associated insurance contracts.
Policy loans are fully collateralized by the account value of the associated insurance contracts.
Loan - Dutch State obligation : The carrying value of the State of the Netherlands (the Dutch State ) loan obligation is based on the outstanding loan balance plus any unamortized premium.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments The Company analyzes its general account investments to determine whether there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis.
Factors considered in this analysis include, but are not limited to, the length of time 41 and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, the issuer s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic conditions and market forecasts, interest rate changes, and changes in ratings of the security.

When assessing the Company s intent to sell a security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its cost basis, management evaluates facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to rebalance the investment portfolio and sales of investments to meet cash flow needs.
When assessing the Company s intent to sell a security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its cost basis, management evaluates facts and circumstances such as, but not limited to, decisions to rebalance the investment portfolio and sales of investments to meet cash flow needs.
When the Company has determined it has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value has declined below amortized cost ( intent impairment ) the individual security is written down from amortized cost to fair value and a corresponding charge is recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ).

If the Company does not intend to sell the security nor is it more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, but the Company has determined that there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis, the OTTI is bifurcated into the amount representing the present value of the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected ( credit impairment ) and the amount related to other factors ( noncredit impairment ).

The noncredit impairment is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 320, Investments Debt and Equity Securities .
In order to determine the amount of the OTTI that is considered a credit impairment, the Company estimates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based upon the best estimate of expected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying debt security.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments The Company analyzes its general account investments to determine whether there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis.
Factors considered in this analysis include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, the issuer s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic conditions and market forecasts, interest rate changes, and changes in ratings of the security.

When the Company has determined it has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value has declined below amortized cost ( intent impairment ) the individual security is written down from amortized cost to fair value and a corresponding charge is recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ).

If the Company does not intend to sell the security nor is it more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, but the Company has determined that there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis, the OTTI is bifurcated into the amount representing the present value of the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected ( credit impairment ) and the amount related to other factors ( noncredit impairment ).

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments The Company analyzes its general account investments to determine whether there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis.
Factors considered in this analysis include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, the issuer s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic conditions and market forecasts, interest rate changes, and changes in ratings of the security.

When the Company has determined it has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value has declined below amortized cost ( intent impairment ) the individual security is written down from amortized cost to fair value and a corresponding charge is recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ).
