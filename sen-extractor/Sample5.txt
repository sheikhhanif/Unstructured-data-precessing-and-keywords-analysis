When we retain new residual securities during a period when short-term interest rate increases are greater than anticipated by the forward yield curve, we generally are more susceptible to impairments on our newer mortgage securities as they do not have sizable unrealized gains to help offset the decline in value.

The fair value of MSR s is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions.
Changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the greatest impact on the fair value of MSR s. Generally, as interest rates decline, prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of MSR s. Conversely, as interest rates rise, prepayments typically slow down, which generally results in an increase in the fair value of MSR s. All assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary to reflect current and anticipated market conditions.

In January 2007, the FASB provided a scope exception under SFAS 155 for securitized interests that only contain an embedded derivative that is tied to the prepayment risk of the underlying prepayable financial assets, and for which the investor does not control the right to accelerate the settlement.

If a securitized interest contains any other embedded derivative (for example, an inverse floater), then it would be subject to the bifurcation tests in SFAS 133, as would securities purchased at a significant premium.

Interest income on mortgage loans held-in-portfolio increased for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 as a result of higher average mortgage loan balances due to the on-balance sheet securitizations accounted for as financings we executed in 2007 and 2006.

This increase was offset by lower interest income from our mortgage securities due to the addition of lower-yielding securities and credit deterioration of the mortgage loans underlying the mortgage securities.

Another major driver in the decline in net interest income (expense) for both 2007 and 2006 was the fact that we experienced a significant increase in our provision for credit losses, which was a result of the on-balance sheet securitizations we executed in 2007 and 2006, as well as overall credit deterioration in the mortgage loan portfolio.

Fair Value Adjustments.
We recorded net (losses) gains due to fair value adjustments of $(85.8) million, $(3.2) million and $0.5 million related to our trading securities and the asset-backed bonds issued in our CDO transaction executed during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The trading securities had a fair value adjustment of approximately $(342.9) million, $(3.2) million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, while the CDO asset-backed bonds had a positive fair value adjustment of $257.1 million in 2007.

These adjustments were a result of significant spread widening in the subprime mortgage market for these types of asset-backed securities as well as poor credit performance of the underlying mortgage loans.

Impairment on Mortgage Securities Available-for-Sale.

After this option period, minimum monthly payments increase by no more than 7.50% per year unless the unpaid balance increases to a specified limit, which is no more than 125% of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established.

Specifically, our underwriting standards for MTA loans required, at the date of funding, that the borrower meet secondary market debt-service ratio tests designed to ensure that they can make the fully amortizing loan payment assuming the loan s interest rate is fully indexed.

This is because when the required monthly payments for pay-option loans eventually increase (in a period not to exceed 60 months), borrowers may be less able to pay the increased amounts and, therefore, more likely to default on the loan, than a borrower with an amortizing loan.
